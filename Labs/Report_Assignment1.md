# Assignment - Workflow for AI-project

<a href="http://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a>

The goal of this report is to attempt to describe a workflow to get an overview of the most common steps in creating a machinelearning application. In this example the application will attepempt to get an overview of the price ranges of houses. The price ranges will be based on different features such as amount of rooms, sieze, location. 

To begin the process we research if this has been done before, which it most likley has. Similiar applications has been done by people trying on  Kaggles competition [^source4] regarding the same subject  

In order to gather data, depending 

We will begin by marking up everything required
