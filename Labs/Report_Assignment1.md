# Assignment - Workflow for AI-project

The goal of this report is to attempt to describe a workflow to get an overview of the most common steps in creating a machinelearning application. In this example the application will attepempt to get an overview of the price ranges of houses. The price ranges will be based on different features such as amount of rooms, sieze, location. 

To begin the process we research if this has been done before, which it most likley has. Similiar applications has been done by people trying on Kaggles competition [^source4] regarding the same subject.    

In order to gather data, depending on the scale and budget of the project we can approach it in a few different ways. If its a large project with a high budget we could pay for already collected data to use in our machinelearning module. One advantage to this method is we get alot of data quickly and is less time consuming that collecting it ourselfs. If we however wish to gather the data ourselves then tryo labs [^source5] has written an indepth guide on how we could approach this. Everything from maps, pictures, house sieze, neighboorhood school, rents, emergency service, socioeconmic enviroments and more would need to be collected.  

Tryo labs recommend utilizing a great variety of sources for this data, the more sources, the more data, the more data the more accurate our application will become. One soild example from tryo labs is the usage of 

We will begin by marking up everything required
